# [TPAMI-2025] Spatial Residual for Underwater Object Detection

- TensorRT weights (In Tab. 8) are now available.

Theoretically, these weights can be used on the same Volta architecture as V100 or on a later architecture that supports the same features (e.g. Ampere architecture, etc.), and you can use them to do some prediction work, and the other weights will be disclosed with the code later.

- The training code will be made public.
